Sample project to test knowledge in `useState`. The project displays an array of products, with a form on top of the table that lets you filter through the `name`, `description`, and `price` columns. Each product's name is clickable, and displays a modal that shows other product information. Check out the [live version](https://inventory-search.norugie.me/).
